<!---The following chunk allows errors when knitting--->

```{r allow errors, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE, warning = FALSE)
```

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gapminder))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tsibble))
```


This worksheet contains exercises aimed for practice with `dplyr`. 


1. (a) What's the minimum life expectancy for each continent and each year? (b) Add the corresponding country to the tibble, too. (c) Arrange by min life expectancy.
Not mutuate because vector is smaller

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(continent, year) %>% 
  summarize(min_life = min(lifeExp),
            country = country[lifeExp == min_life]) %>%
  arrange(min_life)
```

2. Calculate the growth in population since the first year on record _for each country_ by rearranging the following lines, and filling in the `FILL_THIS_IN`. Here's another convenience function for you: `dplyr::first()`. 



```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  arrange(year) %>% 
  mutate(rel_growth = pop - first(pop)) %>% 
  DT::datatable()
```


3. Determine the country that experienced the sharpest 5-year drop in life expectancy, in each continent, sorted by the drop, by rearranging the following lines of code. Ensure there are no `NA`'s. Instead of using `lag()`, use the convenience function provided by the `tsibble` package, `tsibble::difference()`: =diff-lag  .  arrange is independent of groups--> dont need to ungroup at end  of code 



```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(country) %>% 
  arrange(year) %>%
  mutate(inc_life_exp = difference(lifeExp)) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  filter(inc_life_exp == min(inc_life_exp)) %>%
  arrange(inc_life_exp) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```
